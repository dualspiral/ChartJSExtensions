In one line: Extensions for ChartJS that I've quickly whipped up for personal and/or work use. MIT licence.

BarColoured extension - by making the value an object of the form:

    {
      value: value,
      fillColor: colour,
      strokeColor: colour,
      highlightFile: colour,
      highlightStroke: colour
    }

To use the defaults (and work like a bar chart), just have the value as an ordinary number.
